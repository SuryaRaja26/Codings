Introduction:

The Spring framework(which is commonly known as Spring) has emerged as a solution to all these complications This framework uses various new techniques such as
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Plain Old Java Object (POJO), and dependency injection (DI), to develop enterprise applications.

The Spring framework consists of seven modules which are shown in the above Figure. These modules are Spring Core, Spring AOP, Spring Web MVC, Spring DAO, Spring ORM,
Spring context, and Spring Web flow.
